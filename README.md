# Skin_Cancer_Detection_using_CNN
A deep learning-based project for detecting skin cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This model classifies dermatoscopic images to assist in early diagnosis of malignant and benign skin lesions. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the HAM10000 dataset for accurate and efficient skin lesion classification.
